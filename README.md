## What is this and why do I care?
This is quickstart documentation for the Spinnaker Gardening Days #communityHack, a series of open-source Spinnaker hackathons open to anyone in the community, including newcomers. The goal of this doc is help you get started participating.

Right now, humans are more isolated than ever; however, we're coming together virtually like never before. The culture of dispersed and asynchronous collaboration at the foundation of open source seems more relevant than ever as we must together rise to a totally overwhelming and frightening global challenge. Spinnaker Gardening Days aims to shine a light of fun and hope into our community. We envision a future of great software delivery bringing us closer to the experiences that matter. 

Let's solve together; you'll have fun, we promise!

## When is the event?
This second event will take place online on July 16th - 23rd, 2020. [Click here](https://go.armory.io/gardening) to register. Tickets are available for the hackathon and dedicated training workshops. 

## How should I prepare to participate in Spinnaker Gardening?
1. Register for the event [on Eventbrite](https://go.armory.io/gardening)
2. [Join Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io) and join the following channels:
    * **[#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF)**   Make general, public conversation. Please use threads for (welcome!) jokes and side conversations.
    * **[#gardening-ineedhelp](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CURFZGL2E)**   Request help from experts during the hackathon, or ask setup questions before it starts.
3. Ask your organization to support you in spending time at the event. [Use this flyer](https://s.armory.io/v1ur0KQQ) to highlight the benefits of participating (TL;DR - expert tips, network with fellow Spinnaker devs, free training, exposure for your company).
4. Visit the [Project Ideas Wiki](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon/gardening/wiki/Project-Ideas) in the Gardening Wiki tab. 
   * Review the ideas. If you have follow-up ideas, questions, or enthusiasm for an idea, join the listed __#gardening-idea-XXXXXX__ channel in Slack to discuss it.
   * If you have a project idea, follow the instructions to add it. Then, go to Spinnaker Slack and create the Channel Name you specified. 
5. Read the [Plugin Users Guide](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/plugin-users/) to learn about the new plugin framework for Spinnaker. Project teams should strongly consider building extensions and customizations as plugins, to accelerate progress and make projects easier to maintain. Leverage an existing Gradle build and extension points in Spinnaker's microservices. Look out for more in-depth plugin training soon!
6. Leverage our ramp-up materials. We will announce in **#gardening-general** and publish the links on this page when they are available.

## Teams and First Timers
This time, team formation is on us. The registration questions will help us to create balanced teams of 2-5. Then, our team of Spinnaker community experts can help you choose the perfect project and will be on call to advise you through the week. Consult and collaborate through blockers.

We'll explore, learn, and take action. Register today and grow Spinnaker with us! Once you're registered, ping us in the #gardening-general channel in Spinnaker Slack to get started.


## What activities can I expect to find at the July event?
Teams will meet to work on Spinnaker projects during work blocks, and for as much time as desired between the 7/16 Kickoff and 7/23 Show & Tell sessions.

New to Spinnaker? This event offers other opportunities to join the community. Lunchtime speaker panels will offer Spinnaker and software delivery wisdom. The Docs SIG will host an activity channel for building Spinnaker.io resources. If you want to host an activity, speak up in __#gardening-general__.

## How will you select a winning team?
This is a collaborative hackathon, so there won't be one winning team. However, community awards and **prizes will be given to all teams that present at the Demo**. After the hackathon ends, a community voting period will happen in Spinnaker Slack to select the **Community's Choice Project**. The Community Choice Project will get recognized at Spinnaker Summit in October. 


## Do I need to build something production-ready to participate?
NO! A top goal of this event: build the community and give participants a chance to get to know each other. Your team isn't required to build something that’s fully working. If you get halfway through a project and it no longer makes sense, you will have likely learned a lot and made connections. Stay and hang out! While we're sure to come out with some useful features, fixes, or plugins, this is supposed to be fun. It does not need to be feature complete.

## Should we build our project as a Spinnaker plugin?
Yes, if possible! Read the [Plugin Users Guide](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/plugin-users/) to learn more about how to use and build Spinnaker plugins.

## To Be Announced:
Look out for a **training schedule** and **training playlists**, a **team and project matching timeline**, a **prize package breakdown**, and more.
